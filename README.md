# pandect

> [*pandect*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandect) is an Ancient Greek or Roman word meaning a compendium or digest compiled as a summarised collection. Its origins are based on codification of Roman laws, with the word itself also being used to refer to a digest in general use.

A pandect is a digest providing periodic summary and overview for State of the Art (SotA) in specific domains. A pandect should be periodically updated to reflect the ever-evolving SotA. Therefore, there will always be a need for contribution, updates, and analysis within the pandects. This project has been started to create a collaborative platform for everyone to access, comment, and contribute towards collecting resources to avoid repetition of work in research.
